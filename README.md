## Star Wars Planets

Front-end project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

The goal of the project was to develop a list with filters of planets from the Star Wars universe, using __Context API__ and __Hooks__ to control its global state.

### Skills

With this project I was able to:

 - Make use of the _Context API_ from React to manage state;
 - Make use of the React Hooks _useState_, _useContext_ and _UseEffect_;
